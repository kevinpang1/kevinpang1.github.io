### About Mig:
Iâ€™m a graphic and product designer from Chicago, leading design at [Trunk Club](http://trunkclub.com) and serving as President for [AIGA Chicago](http://chicago.aiga.org).

### About this site:
This site is hand made with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) using Sass and CoffeeScript for assets. These are my template files to build everything at http://mig.pizza. Feel free to poke around to get ideas for your next Jekyll project.
