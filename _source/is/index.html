  <article class="about-biography-long">
    <h1>I&rsquo;m a designer exploring the intersection of brand, marketing, and product design working as Design Lead for <a href="http://trunkclub.com" target="_blank">Trunk Club</a>. I also proudly serve as the President of <a href="http://chicago.aiga.org" target="_blank">AIGA Chicago</a>.</h1>

    <p>Before joining Trunk Club, I spent the last four years working as both a product and communications designer at Basecamp. There, I designed and led brand and marketing projects for the popular <a href="http://basecamp.com" target="_blank">project management app</a>, shipped new features, improved conversion and retention of our customers, shaped the Basecamp voice through marketing experiments and writing, all the way to new product prototyping. I learned to try new ideas often, and approached the spirit of our <a href="http://37svn.com/3646" target="_blank">work like scientists would</a>. Every day I helped make sure our customers felt super loved.</p>
    <p>Before Basecamp, I cut my teeth as the first full-time interactive designer at Threadless. There, I designed much of the marketing campaigns, brand standards, and Threadless.com interfaces. It was there where I learned how to take care of your community and try new ideas, no matter how weird. I also accidentally moonlit as a t-shirt model, but thankfully for everyone else that career was short-lived. Leading up to Threadless, I toughened my skin working at studios and agencies making work for clients including AIGA, Google, Harley-Davidson, Rand McNally, Sears, Segura Inc, SC Johnson, and Valspar.</p>
    <p>Teaching, mentoring, and community outreach make up the latter half of my time. Iâ€™m working hard every day to make the Chicago design community a better place by serving as President for <a href="http://chicago.aiga.org" target="_blank">AIGA Chicago</a>. I also maintain a design video blog, <a href="http://humblepied.com" target="_blank">Humble Pied</a>, which showcases short videos from inspirational designers sharing quick bits of advice. I also started and organized the <a href="http://creativemornings.com/cities/chi" target="_blank">CreativeMornings Chicago</a> chapter for two years, ultimately passing the reigns to my friends Kim and Kyle at <a href="http://www.knoed.com" target="_blank">Knoed</a>. Beyond all that I serve as a mentor within design, tech, and startup organizations. (Phew.)</p>
    <p>I like my pizza hot, my coffee black, and my beer hoppy.</p>

      I lead design at <a href="http://trunkclub.com" target="_blank">Trunk Club</a>, where we&rsquo;re working hard to redesign retail and what it means for people to find confidence through personal style. Formerly Basecamp, Threadless, and a smattering of studios and agencies. Beliefs: try new things, humility over hubris, build your community, and have some fucking fun with your work.<br>

  <h3>Colophon</h3>

  <p>This site is designed with a six-column grid from <a href="http://Basecamp.com/svn/posts/1061-why-we-skip-photoshop" target="_blank">sketch to code</a>. Programmed with <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2" target="_blank">Sublime Text 2</a> using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, Sass, jQuery paired with <a href="http://coffeescript.org" target="_blank">CoffeeScript</a>, and <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org" target="_blank">Rake</a> tasks for compilation and deployment to Dreamhost. Version controlled with Git on <a href="http://github.com/migreyes">GitHub</a>. The body typeface is GT Sectra, while the complimentary sans-serif is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/family/alto/" target="_blank">Alto</a> by OurType. Photoshop and Illustrator fired up for imagery. Probably swore a lot when I broke something in the code. Get weird.</p>
