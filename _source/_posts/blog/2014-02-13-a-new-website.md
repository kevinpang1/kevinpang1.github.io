To celebrate my 2-year anniversary at Basecamp, I spent some time collecting the work and essays I’ve done in the last few years. Nothing fancy. It’s mostly words arranged on a page. Which, I guess, is [what web design is anyway](http://ia.net/blog/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period/). I’ve had a lot of fun building it. If you’re curious, [you can pick apart the code on GitHub](https://github.com/migreyes/migreyes).

Are you a designer that wants to get a jump start using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)? I extracted my two years of experience making sites with Jekyll into a super basic [starting point called Hazelnut](http://github.com/migreyes/hazelnut). There’s nothing fancy about it—just my commonly used Sass mixins and a slew of Rake tasks to get you going.

Blog post bonus: I keep every version of my website online. For archival and posterity, sure, but mainly so you can feel *really* good about your own website and laugh at all of my old ones.
