# A fine line exists between spelling out company culture and inadvertently engraving it as policy.

Culture offers your staff the company blog’s “publish” button 24/7 so that they can write when their own iron is hot. Policy forces topics and a posting schedule to chip away at the company marketing quota.

Culture inspires your programmers to discover typographic rhythm and scale in their free time. Policy puts a “lunch and learn with designers” meeting on your calendar at 12:00 PM.

Culture nurtures pet projects so that they grow into everyday company tools. Policy steals 20% of your staff’s work hours to gamble on forced research and development.

Culture does. Policy says. 
Culture encourages. Policy requires. 
Culture empowers. Policy mandates. 
Culture simply happens—it isn’t created.
